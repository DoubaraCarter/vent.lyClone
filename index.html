          <h2>What makes our <br />heart <span>beat</span></h2>
          <p>
            Like most ideas,the eniter concept of Vently was not fully formed
            when we<br />
            started off in Port Harcourt.<br /><br />

            The initial plan was to build was a platform that connected event
            attendees <br>
            to each other. but we discovered it could be way more than
            that. Now we’re<br>
            building a platform that let’s you interact more in a live or
            physical event<br />
            and also an opportunity to get paid while doing it. Whether you’re
            an <br />attendee, event organizer, or event vendor – we’re
            extending an invitation<br />
            to you to be part of our amazing journey.

            The easiest way to grow as a vendor or a creator is when your profile is shared with<br>
            tons of potential customers and we’re doing just that for you. All you need to do is<br>
            complete your profile , set a minimum price and start receiving offers from prospective<br> 
            clients who want you to
             perform a certain role at their event.
